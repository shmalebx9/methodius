# R v Grant 2009 SCC 32

## Facts

Mr. Grant was walking with a backpack when two plain-clothes police officers noticed him acting "suspiciously." Const. Gomes, a uniformed officer, was sent to question Mr. Grant. Gomes stood in front of Mr. Grant, blocking his path on the sidewalk. The two plainclothes officers arrived, flashed their badges and took up positions further blocking Mr. Grant's path. When officer Gomes noticed Mr. Grant's hands moving towards his person he ordered Mr. Grant to keep his hands in front of him. Mr. Grant admitted on further questioning to having a firearm which was confiscated by police and taken into evidence. At no point did officers inform Mr. Grant of his right to counsel.

## Issue

regarding the exclusion of evidence based on a charter breach, section 24(2) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* states:

>(2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

In this case, the issue is under what circumstances admission of evidence obtained via a charter breach may be admissible.

## Rule

The previous test for inadmissibility was based on the Collins and Stillman cases. These cases established that the test for excluding evidence was whether the evidence was conscriptive (was the defendant compelled to give evidence against himself) and whether the evidence was discoverable (could the police have reasonably found the evidence without the charter breach).

The new test created in this case is to balance three factors in determining exclusion

+ The seriousness of the offence
+ The impact of the Charter breach on the charter protected interest(s) of the accused
+ Society's interest in a proper adjudication of the case on its merits

## Analysis

The original test for exclusion was **conscription** and **discoverability**. The conscription test rests on the foundation that an accused cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself (Charter 11(C)). If the result of a charter breach was that an accused was conscripted to produce evidence against himself, then that evidence should be excluded. The discoverability test constrains the exclusion of evidence. If evidence obtained in temporal or causal relation to a charter breach could reasonably have been obtained without the charter breach then it should be admissible. The court found that the conscription test was too narrow since it views all types of evidence through the lens of testimony. The discoverability test was found lacking since it forces judged to become too speculative.

In determining whether Mr. Grants charter right (s. 9) against abritrary detention was violated the court considered what interest the charter right protected. The court found that s.9 was meant to protect citizen's liberty against unjustified state interference. Since a reasonable person in Mr. Grant's position would have believed they were not free to leave, he was unlawfully detained. Since Mr. Grant was, in fact, detained his charter right to counsel was violated as well.

The court decided to implement a new three-pronged test to determine whether evidence obtained through a charter breach is admissible. The new test focuses on determining whether the admission of evidence will bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Factor one is the severity of the charter breach, which includes a consideration of whether the breach was invasive and whether the police were acting in good faith. The second factor is the extent to which the charter negatively impacts the specific interest protected by the charter. The final factor is societiy's interest in a proper adjudication of the case on its merits.

The court found that the officers were acting in good faith when they detained, questioned, and searched Mr. Grant. Though they did breach his charter rights, they did not believe he was detained and therefore did not purposely flout the charter. The court identified that s.10(b) protects a citizens interest in making an informed decision about what information to give to the police. Since the primary evidence obtained by the police (the gun) would not have been obtained had Mr. Grant spoken to counsel, the impact on his protect interest was significant. Society's interest in the adjudication of the case is in favour of admission insofar as gun crimes are a serious threat to public safety. On the other hand, society has a strong interest in exclusion insofar as citizens should expect that charter rights be taken especially seriously in the case of serious crime. Therefore, society's interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits has does not tend towards admission or exclusion.

## Conclusion

The court held that the gun evidence is admissible in the case of Mr. Grant. The court however, stipulated that in the future similar cases will be adjudicated with less leniency towards the crown since officers are more informed (having known the outcome of this case). Mr. Grant's conviction for "transporting" a firearm was quashed since the court did not believe that the statute relating to transportation of a firearm applied in his case.

## Note

The specific issue of the type of gun crime committed by Mr. Grant took up few words in the decision and was not the focus of the court's opinion. The details on the issue of the gun "transportation" are therefore mostly omitted from this brief.
