# Reading Notes 

## Sources of Evidentiary Rules (CB 86)

There are two main sources of rules relating to the admissibility and gathering of evidence in criminal proceedings:

+ The Common law (eg. Hearsay rule)
+ The Charter (eg. 10b right to counsel)
    + There are also a few statutory rules in the *Criminal Code* and the *Canada Evidence Act*

## Admisibility (CB 86)
In general, evidence is admissible if)

+ the evidence is relevant to a fact at issue
+ the probative outweighs the prejudicial
+ it is not excluded by any statutory or common law rule
+ it is not excluded under the charter

## Confession Rules (CB 86)
In General, statements made outside court cannot be introduced as evidence of the truth of their contents (Hearsay). There are however, exceptions for confessions made outside the court to a third person or overheard by a third person. If the confession is made to an agent of the state (police officer) then the crown must prove the following before the confession is admissible)

+ The confession was voluntary (not given in exchange for reward or to avoid punishment)
+ The confession was the product of an "operating mind"
+ The confession was not elicited in "oppressive" circumstances

In the case of "Mr. Big" operations, the SCC found in R v. Hart that the crown must prove the probative outweighs the prejudicial before entering the confession as evidence.^[test footnote]

## Right to Cousel

>10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention
>(a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor;
>(b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; and
>(c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful.

Charter 10(b) gives the accused who have been detained the right to)

+ Be informed that they have the right to counsel
+ Retain and instruct counsel without delay

When 10(b) is not followed the evidence may still be admitted if)

+ The accused is not reasonably diligent in exercising their rights
+ or) there are exigent circumstances

Once the 10(b) right is engaged the police must

+ provide the accused with reasonable access to counsel
+ refrain form questioning until the accused has consulted counsel
    + the right to counsel may be waived by the accused as long as they do it with full knowledge of the consequences

## Exclusion of Evidence on Charter claim (CB 145)

>24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances. Marginal note:Exclusion of evidence bringing administration of justice into disrepute (2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

When making a charter claim, the burden of proof is on the accused to show their rights were infringed upon **and** that this infringement led to the collection of the evidence which the accused seeks to have excluded. The accused must prove)

+ That their charter rights were infringed
+ That the infringement led to the evidence in question
	+ does not need to be a strict causal link, the collection of the evidence must be "not too remote" from the breach
+ That the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute

## Search, Seizure, and the Right to Privacy (CB 185-186)

>8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.

For a charter 8 challenge the accused must)

+ have a privacy interest recognized by the courts
+ the activities must be describable as "search," or "seizure"
+ the activity must have been performed by state agents

Generally, for a search to be considered reasonable it must)

+ Be done by a peace officer
+ be done under the authority of a search warrant
+ the warrant must be obtained prior to the search
+ the warrant must be issued by a judicial officer

In order for police to obtain a warrant an peace officer must provide sworn testimony to a judicial officer as to demonstrating the reasonable belief that *particular* evidence pertaining to a *particular* crime exists in the indicated place to be searched. Searches without warrant are presumptively unreasonable.

# R v Le

One evening, three police officers noticed four Black men and one Asian man in the backyard of a townhouse at a Toronto housing co-operative. The young men appeared to be doing nothing wrong.

--

Officers noticed five men, 4 black, one asian (Le) in the backyard of a housing co-operative. The officers entered the backyard despite the men seemingly doing nothing wrong. One officer patrolled the perimeter of the property, stepped over the fence and yelled at one young man to keep his hands where the officer could see them. Another officer issued the same order.

--

Mr. Le fled, was pursued and arrested, and found to be in possession of a firearm, drugs and cash.

--

In convicting Mr. Le, the trial judge held that he lacked standing to advance a s. 8 claim, there being no objective reasonableness

--

A majority at the Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed, accepting that, had it found breaches, it would not have excluded the evidence as any breach would have been “technical, inadvertent, and made in good faith”

----

issues: 

1. whether this encounter between the police and Mr. Le infringed his right to be free from arbitrary detention; and 
2. whether an invited houseguest enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy while on the host’s premises.

----

the circumstances of the police entry into the backyard effected a detention that was both immediate and arbitrary

----

This was serious Charter-infringing police misconduct, with a correspondingly high impact on Mr. Le’s protected interests. Indeed, it was precisely this sort of police conduct that the Charter was intended to abolish. On balance, the admission of the evidence would, in our view, bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
We would, therefore, allow the appeal, exclude the evidence seized from Mr. Le, set aside his convictions and enter acquittals.

----

the stature of the fence (calling it a “little two-foot fenc[e]” or a “little mini fence” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 
196)), each acknowledged its significance. That is, all officers understood the backyard was private property

----

This common police practice of asking individuals who they are and demanding proof of their identities for no apparent reason has its own name. It is known as “carding”

----

the analysis of whether s. 9 of the Charter has been infringed proceeds in two stages. The first stage inquires into whether the claimant was detained at all. If that leads to the conclusion that the claimant was detained, the second stage of analysis inquires into whether the detention was arbitrary. Both stages attract a correctness standard of review.

----

he was detained when the police entered the backyard and made contact. 
Since no statutory or common law power authorized his detention at that point

----

the determination of the timing of the detention is not advanced by repeating that the police officers had “legitimate investigatory purposes”, “valid investigatory objectives”, “legitimate investigative aims”, “valid investigatory purposes” and were conducting a “legitimate investigation”

----

The legitimacy of any investigation in the context of s. 9 is measured against whether these objectives give rise to reasonable suspicion or not.

----

The legitimacy of any investigation in the context of s. 9 is measured against whether these objectives give rise to reasonable suspicion or not. 
We conclude that they did not and that the detention was therefore arbitrary.

----

While not determinative, when the police enter a private residence as trespassers, it both colours what happens subsequently and strongly supports a finding of detention at that point in time.

----

he is described as being 20 years old, of Asian descent, and of small stature.

----

A reasonable person in the shoes of the accused is deemed to know about how relevant race relations would affect an interaction between police officers and four Black men and one Asian man in the backyard of a townhouse at a Toronto housing co-operative.

----

supports a conclusion that a detention arose as soon as the police entered the backyard

----

Merely because an individual has had repeated interactions with the police does not mean that the individual has acquired a level of sophistication in dealing with the police

----

The appellant testified that he believed he was free to leave the backyard after the police had entered and began questioning the young men. In other words, he did not think he was detained

----

A reasonable person who has been stopped by the police on multiple prior occasions would more likely perceive that it is necessary to simply submit to police demands.

----

Mr. Le’s level of sophistication

----

the Crown has argued that claimants’ subjective perceptions about whether or not they were detained are “highly relevant”. We do not accept this argument. It remains, and should remain, that the detention analysis is principally objective in nature.

----

and was, therefore, arbitrary. None of the investigative purposes found by the trial judge authorized the officers’ actions, and they were themselves trespassers.

----

a suspect’s presence in a “so-called high crime area” is not by itself a basis for detention

----

Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing Conduct

----

[t]his was serious police misconduct

----

b) Impact on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused

----

Regardless of how it is framed, there simply were no grounds, let alone reasonable grounds, to suspect any criminal wrongdoing was committed or being committed by the young men in the backyard. The discovery of the evidence was only possible because of the serious s. 9 breach in this case.

----

How, then, are we to understand the impact of this police misconduct on Mr. Le’s Charter-protected interest in his liberty from unjustified state interference?

----

Society’s Interest in Adjudication of the Case on its Merits

----

to abolish. Admission of the fruits of that conduct would bring the administration of justice into disrepute

----

An “adjudication on the merits”, in a rule of law state, presupposes an adjudication grounded in legality and respect for longstanding constitutional norms.

----

On balance, this line of inquiry provides support for admitting the evidence.

----

This is precisely the sort of police conduct that the Charter was intended to protect against.

----

Le wins and is aquitted.
